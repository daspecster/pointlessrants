title: 'Public IP'

---

When you work with computers and networks, you often need to know the public-facing IP address of the device you're working on.  There are tons of sites out there that can give you that information, but many of them are cluttered with ads or other HTML code you don't really want to deal with if you want to get your external IP on the command line.

I used to use <a title="checkip.dyndns.org" href="http://checkip.dyndns.org">checkip.dyndns.org</a>.

<code>$ curl checkip.dyndns.org
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Current IP Check&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Current IP Address: xx.xxx.xx.xxx&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>

It was pretty simple and straightforward, but it still had HTML code to strip out.

I came across a better site for this today, <a title="icanhazip.com" href="http://icanhazip.com">icanhazip.com</a>.

<code>$ curl icanhazip.com
xx.xxx.xx.xxx</code>

Let me know what you think or if you know of one that's better.  I'm betting you'll have a hard time coming up with one that is more simple than <a title="icanhazip.com" href="http://icanhazip.com/">icanhazip.com</a> though.
