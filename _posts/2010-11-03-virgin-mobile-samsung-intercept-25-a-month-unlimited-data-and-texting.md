<h1>Virgin Mobile Samsung Intercept $25 a month unlimited data and texting</h1>
<h2>Pure Awesome!</h2>
That's what I have to say about Virgin Mobile's new plan and phones. Seriously for $25 a month you can get 300 anytime minutes and unlimited texting and unlimited data.
You don't get any night or weekend minutes but I don't use that many minutes anyway. Also if you NEED more minutes you can switch to the $40 a month plan which has 1200 minutes and there's also a $60 a month plan which is unlimited minutes, texts, data! Seriously! Cheapest plan out there!

Now in the past the problem would be either poor service or crappy phones. Today, <a title="Virgin Mobile USA" href="http://www.virginmobileusa.com">Virgin Mobile</a> is using the <a title="Sprint Wireless" href="http://www.sprint.com">Sprint</a> network which may not be the best right now but they have been working pretty well for me for the last 3 years.  Virgin Mobile also recently released an Android phone, the <a title="Samsung Intercept" href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SPH-M910ZKASPR">Samsung Intercept</a>. This phone has really good reviews from <a title="Cnet Review Virgin Mobile Samsung Intercept" href="http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/samsung-intercept-virgin-mobile/4505-6452_7-34183900.html?tag=mncol;lst">Cnet</a>.  I've bought two of them in the last month because my girlfriend and I were going to switch from Sprint(Long story) and the phones seem really solid.
<h2>About the Samsung Intercept</h2>
It's not perfect. No phone is perfect really I suppose but for the money(I think you might be able to get them from <a title="Best Buy Virgin Mobile Samsung Intercept" href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Virgin+Mobile+-+Samsung+Intercept+No-Contract+Mobile+Phone+-+Dark+Gray/1409226.p?id=1218255995990&amp;skuId=1409226&amp;st=virgin%20mobile&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=1">BestBuy</a> for $220.) it's near perfect, especially since you have no contract with it.
Firstly there's the screen. It's physically just too small for a touch interface. It works,  it's not like you can't get by but if it was bigger that would make it easier to use. The keyboard should make up for that issue but it was a little awkward for me at first. Just the placement of keys wasn't the same as anything I've used before.  Didn't take long to adjust though.

Using it isn't so bad considering that the processor is a mere 667mhz! I loaded many apps on it and it ran everything just fine. I don't do much for games though so I don't know how good of a graphics processor it has.

For an awesome deal there isn't really any plans out there that match it. I think Virgin Mobile is setting a standard for pricing in the mobile market with these new plans. If the major carriers like Sprint, Verizon and AT&amp;T aren't concerned then they should be.
