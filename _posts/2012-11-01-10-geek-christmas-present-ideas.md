Speaking as a geek, I know it's hard for people to shop for me. Us geeks kind of have different kinds of things that we're interested in that other people just don't know about.

So I made a list of a few things that I currently enjoy or I'm looking to purchase soon.


&nbsp;
<h3>CM Storm QuickFire Rapid - Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with Blue CHERRY MX Switches</h3>
<p>I got this a few months ago and I will never go back. This has increased my typing accuracy and made typing just more fun! *click* *click* *click*!</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>FiiO E7 USB DAC and Portable Headphone Amplifier</h3>
<p>This is something that people at work actually turned me on to. I never thought it would make that big of a difference. I can actually hear each piece of the drum kit in my songs now. This is a great starter for future audiophiles out there.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>CM Storm QuickFire Rapid - Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with Red CHERRY MX Switches (SGK-4000-GKCR1-US)</h3>
<p>This mechanical keyboard is much like the other one but this one doesn't *click*, so it won't bother your co-workers.</p>

<h3>Starter Kit for Newsite Uno R3 - Bundle of 6 Items: Newsite Uno R3, Breadboard, Holder, Jumper Wires, USB Cable and 9V Battery Connector</h3>
<p>Lots of geeks are crazy about Adruino programming. This allows us to take out software skills and make them do physical things. This board helps us automate things in the real world and we like automation!</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>Audio-Technica ATHM50S Professional Monitor Headphones</h3>
<p>These headphones are something that's on my list of things to get soon! They come as a recommendation from my audiophile friends at work. They're studio monitors, so they should be excellent at reproducing the original sounds in the music. No added bass or treble, just the real deal.</p>

<h3>Arkon TAB-FSM Tablet Seat Bolt Mount</h3>
<p>Lately I've been driving a lot and I use my iPad for music and navigation. The only place I have to put my iPad is on my passenger seat. This makes is quite difficult to skip songs! With this I'll be able to put my iPad within a safe reach and I won't get distracted trying to hold my iPad just right.</p>
