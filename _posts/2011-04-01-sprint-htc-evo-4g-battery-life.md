<h3>Problem:</h3>
Since Sprint released an update for my HTC EVO 4g (3.70.651.1) my battery life has decreased significantly. The phone wouldn't last much longer than 5 hours.

The battery life drained much faster in areas where I had poor service. This is normal in most cases but after the update the battery drain was much worse.
<h3>Solution:</h3>
It appears that the in the update Sprint released for the HTC EVO 4g (3.70.651.1) increased some of the polling for the 3G data connection.Â So if I turn the wifi on and have it connect to access points instead of having it search for 3G then my battery lasts all day long and then some.
