I know how cookies work
=======================
So stop telling me!
-------------------

I'm sure many have noticed that the cookie banners are back. They have been for a while.
This is really disappointing to me. While, I think it's great to raise awareness of the issue of
cookies and collecting data from visitors, it's also pretty annoying and distracting when you already know how it works.

It would be better if they told me what data they were saving, but I'm sure that would be boring after visiting a few sites too.
So I try not to complain too much about a subject unless I have some kind of solution.

In this case, my solution is an acknowledgement of awareness. Either in the browser or via browser extension.

The idea being that since I know how cookies work and I'm sick of seeing the same banners across many websites, I should be able 
to check something off so that I don't have to see site design broken or a banner covering up content. Content, that I'm
specifically visiting the site to view.

If the banner specification from ICO made all the banners consistent, either by adding a CSS ID or class then a browser
extension should be able to hide them right off.

Anyway, it's just an idea. If someone makes an extension feel free to tell me @daspecster :)
