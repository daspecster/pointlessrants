<a title="FreedomPop Free Internet Access" href="http://www.freedompop.com/">FreedomPop</a> is a new startup that is offering free internet (500mb per month) to users. Their business plan is selling add-on services. If you want more bandwidth then they charge a small monthly fee.

Right now FreedomPop runs on wireless networks in <a title="FreedomPop Coverage Map" href="http://www.freedompop.com/coverage">many major cities</a>.

Information is crucial in this day and age. The USA isn't leading the pack when it comes to public availability of internet access. Luckily private companies have been stepping up more and more.

To increase education you first need access to information and I think FreedomPop could be leveraged to aid city growth.
