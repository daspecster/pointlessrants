We're back! It's been a long time since our last podcast and we apologize!

This week we talked about why Apple is looking at purchasing ARM, the iPad and some questions we have about Ubuntu's user experience research.
<ul>
	<li>Apple to purchase ARMÂ  (<a title="Apple rumored to buy ARM Holdings" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/04/21/apple_rumored_to_buy_arm_holdings.html">appleinsider.com</a>)</li>
	<li>Ubuntu and notification area elimination (<a title="Farewell to the notification area" href="http://design.canonical.com/2010/04/notification-area/">design.canonical.com</a>)</li>
	<li>Ubuntu and making my freaking network settings disappear, disabling alt-tab, and disabling my task-bar when I tried to fix it...</li>
	<li>iPad hmmmm</li>
</ul>
