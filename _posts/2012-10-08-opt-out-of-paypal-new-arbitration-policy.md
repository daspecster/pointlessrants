<h2>Here's the quick and dirty of how to Opt-Out.</h2>
This is directly from the new policy.
<blockquote><strong>Opt-Out Procedure.</strong>

You can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate ("opt out") by mailing us a written opt-out notice ("Opt-Out Notice").  For new PayPal users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 Days after the date you accept the User Agreement for the first time.  If you are already a current PayPal user and previously accepted the User Agreement prior to the introduction of this Agreement to Arbitrate, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than December 1, 2012. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.

The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to this Agreement to Arbitrate and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the PayPal account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the User Agreement, including all other provisions of Section 14 (Disputes with PayPal), will continue to apply.  Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.</blockquote>
&nbsp;

In short, <strong>before December 1st</strong> you must send a written opt-out notice stating that you do not agree to the "Agreement to Arbitrate" and you have to include your name, address and phone number and email address used to log in to PayPal. You <strong></strong><strong>must sign </strong>the notice and mail it to <strong>PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131</strong>.
