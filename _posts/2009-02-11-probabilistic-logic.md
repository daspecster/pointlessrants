I don't know how a <a href="http://www.rice.edu/nationalmedia/news2009-02-08-pcmos.shtml">probabilistic processor works</a>, but it sounds pretty cool.

I have my suspicions, though, about whether this will ever see the market or whether it really works. It would be nice if the noise problem could be solved without boosting the voltage of the signal.
