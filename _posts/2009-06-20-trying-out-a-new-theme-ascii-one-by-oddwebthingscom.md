Well, we discussed changing the site theme a few weeks ago and everyone seemed in favor of this one, so here it is! Thanks to <a title="Smashing Magazine" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com">SmashingMagazine.com</a> for posting about this cool theme and of course thanks to the creators at <a title="Odd Web Things" href="http://www.oddwebthings.com">OddWebThings.com</a> or making it in the first place!

Also, just an fyi for people is that we hope to be switching domains in the future.

Pointlessrants.com currently mirrors our blog but we want to drop daspecster.com completely.Â  We'll notify you when we start makin changes!
