Title: TOR - Possibly not as secure as we think?
Date: 2013-06-18 12:49 

With all this PRISM talk going around and the lost and forgotten Room 641A, people have been touting the TOR network as a way to keep your web traffic safe and secure.  I would like to open up conversation about the possibility that TOR really isn't that secure from governments.

I have some theories but I haven't made and proof of concepts or ran serious numbers to back this up. I simply would like to attempt to challenge the idea that using TOR will keep you anonymous.

If you don't know how TOR works check out here https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.

One thing theory I have is that TOR is not secure because of potential node saturation. That is say that it may be possible to find an originating node with statistical certainty if you control some number of nodes in the network and correlate all the traffic data.
