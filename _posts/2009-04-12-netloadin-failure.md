Hmm, looks like netload.in is down.  I haven't really ever used it but right now it's giving a 500 error.

Could it have been shut down? Who knows! Data sharing/storing sites come and go faster than celebrities jump in and out of rehab.

<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/netload.in">Netload.in</a> has an Alexa rank of 526<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/netload.in"></a>, in comparison <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/rapidshare.com">rapidshare.com</a> has an alexa rank of 17.

Oh well, we shall see if anything pops up in the news or if the netload.in just had some server issues.

UPDATE:

Netload.in is back up and there wasn't really any explaination to why the site went down.  I guess it wasn't the law interveining!
