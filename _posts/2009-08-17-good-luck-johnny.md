This is basically me using the site to "retweet" :(  But props to JohnnyIHackStuff for helping get technology out to the less fortunate people out there.  I mean even if that kid takes your shipment the laptops are still going to be sold to someone over there that wouldn't have had that opportunity otherwise right?

I have one of those Compaq Evo 610's...pretty sweet laptop.  I would still use it except my sister has it :( But she just got a new macbook pro....hmmm....

Anyway, go Johnny! I really believe in giving people the tools they need to educate them selves.

UPDATE:

So it all worked out!
