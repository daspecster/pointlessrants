I recently picked up a <a href="http://drobo.com/products/drobo.php">Drobo</a> because like many other people in the IT world that know better, I haven't been worried about backing up my data.

The Drobo works quite nicely and provides redundant storage for even the least tech-savvy users.  You can add or remove drives on the fly and the Drobo will automatically move the data on the drives around to provide a solution that gives redundancy first and maximum usable storage second.  It does not optimize for maximum throughput.

If you are just looking for a vat of storage, the Drobo will work well for you.  However, I was expecting to be able to encrypt the Drobo with TrueCrypt and while it is possible, it's much more inconvenient than doing so on a standard single drive or on some type of fixed-size array.  Because the Drobo manages the disks and essentially has a dynamic size based on the disks you add or remove, you cannot use TrueCrypt to do device-level or volume-level encryption because the Drobo is not aware of how to resize with these types of encryption.  If you want to use TrueCrypt on a Drobo, you have to use an encrypted file container.

If you're curious about how much usable storage you'd have available from the Drobo based on sizes of disks you'd put in it, Data Robotics has a friendly calculator for this: <a href="http://www.drobo.com/resources/drobolator.php">Drobolator</a>

Even though there is a slight annoyance when using a Drobo with TrueCrypt, I'd still recommend getting a Drobo.  It provides simple, redundant storage that even your parents can install, use, and maintain.  All they need to do is follow the information provided by the stoplight-type indicators on the right side of the Drobo (and there is a convenient legend inside of the cover).
