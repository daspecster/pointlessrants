I know I'm a little late on news here but I just read <a title="Intel pays AMD 1.25 billion" href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/processors/intel-pays-amd-125-billion">this(IEEE Spectrum)</a> and I thought it was kind of interesting. Apparently Intel is paying AMD 1.25 billion united states dollars!

Can you say "give me a raise"...if you work for AMD that is.

They say that 1.25B was "a small multiple" of what they may have had to pay in court.  Now my question is, what kind of position does this put AMD in for the future? Their stock jumped 16% on the news and their market cap is only 4.38B, so 1.25B is over 25% of what they may be worth.  The down side is that AMD hasn't posted a profit in a while.

The interesting part is that AMD doesn't just make desktop processors anymore right? They also have ATI and a few other irons in the fire. So my question is "what is AMD going to do with their 1.25 billion?"

AMD's processors have kind of let people down in the last few years but they're starting to turn things around by doing things like making a processor that is capable of <a title="AMD Phenom II Breaks 7GHz Barrier" href="http://gizmodo.com/5404507/amd-phenom-ii-breaks-7ghz-barrier">breaking the 7Ghz barrier(Gizmodo)</a>.

We've heard a lot in the past of AMD's grand plans for new processor platforms and their crazy modular ideas but what is really feasible and what would be generally accepted and bought by people?

I think it could be time to start watching AMD again because there should be some crazy stuff coming down the pipes from them.  I mean heck what could you do with 1.25 billion?
