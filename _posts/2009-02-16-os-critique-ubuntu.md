Well, it's time to finish critiquing the Big Three desktop operating systems. I've already critiqued <a href="http://www.daspecster.com/2009/02/os-critique-windows/">Windows</a> and <a href="http://www.daspecster.com/2009/01/os-critique-mac/">Mac</a>, and now I have a few comments about Ubuntu and Linux in general.

<!--more--><h3>Nerd OS</h3>

Linux is pretty powerful, which is why it has appealed to power users for nearly 20 years. The trouble is, it appeals only to power users. Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical have gone a long way in making a Linux distro for the masses, but they have yet to make their system as suitable as their prime competitors Microsoft and Apple. Reports periodically surface about how easy Ubuntu is to use for somebody's non-technical girlfriend, mother, grandmother, or dog, but two flaws remain.

The first flaw is that these girlfriends, mothers, and grandmothers are not doing much other than browse the web and type documents. They are not trying to accomplish any of the semi-complex tasks that many people try at some point or another.

The second flaw is that even if these non-technical souls were to try something complicated (or if they created a problem on accident) there is clearly a nerd nearby to fix the problem. A boyfriend, son, or grandson is easily on hand to remedy any errors.

<h3>Learning Curve</h3>

Part of the problem with Linux is the steepness of the learning curve. When I critiqued about Windows, I noted that its learning curve is about as users expect: a hard task is hard, an easy task is easy. With Linux, easy tasks are often very hard. Ubuntu has improved how easy some easy tasks are to accomplish, but many common tasks remain hard. For instance, what do I do to make Flash work in Firefox if the readily apparent solutions don't work? Edits often have to be made to configuration files to make the simplest things work.

This sort of power is perfectly suited for nerds who have already mastered the learning curve, but for new, non-nerd users, editing configuration files is confusing and seems dangerous. Something as simple as changing permissions can have unexpected side effects for the uninitiated. I know from experience that changing the permissions on /home/ is not a good idea. I did not expect something so simple to lock me out of the system (especially since I was trying to do just the opposite), but I'm sure it makes sense to some nerd.

<h3>Clones</h3>

Every time I encounter a new operating system, I expect it to be wildly different and innovative compared to the last one. When I began using a Mac, for instance, I was disappointed how much it was like Windows. When I began using Linux, I felt the same way. There is remarkably little innovation on the surface. Every interface has its own bells and whistles, but it is functionally identical to its competitors.

Every interface I've discussed so far relies on linear menus, folder management, resizable windows, toolbars, and the desktop metaphor. Perhaps no other ideas are successful, but I doubt that anyone has really tried to invent and implement any new ideas. Each seems to clone the last successful interface. We can argue as long as we want about whether Microsoft stole their interface from Apple, but Ubuntu has clearly adopted the same style. The fact that the open source OS is free and its developers can't be charged with patent infringement has kept Ubuntu from exploring new options.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Linux is a powerful OS, but it may be best suited to servers where nerds are in control. To use an analogy, it is like a bulldozer. It is powerful, but there are a lot of levers and switches that can do serious damage under the control of those who do not know what they are doing. Canonical's attempt to popularize Linux through Ubuntu is a little like trying to make a bulldozer street legal. Some will hope the plan succeeds, others will want the monster off the roads before it breaks something.

My own experience with Ubuntu has been unremarkable. I use it currently for diversity and the experience, but I am not persuaded that it ought to run on everything or even that I ought to put it on a new computer. It is powerful, but it is also easily breakable. The danger and the fragility are not outweighed by anything particularly innovative.
