title: 'No Crossfire Bridge?  C''mon...'

---

I recently ordered parts to build a new tower.  Part of my order included two <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814129113">ATI Radeon 4870</a>'s and a motherboard that supported <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI_CrossFire">Crossfire</a>.  When I came to the moment of truth when I was going to link the cards with the Crossfire bridges, I realized that all of the bridges that I had laying around were for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface">SLI</a>.  The motherboard that supported Crossfire and SLI came with two different SLI bridges and no Crossfire bridges.  Both of the Radeons came without Crossfire bridges as well.  If it wasn't for NewEgg selling lone Crossfire bridges (for ridiculous prices), I would be up the creek.

At any rate, I feel like I've been cheated.  I recently switched over to ATI.  While I was still an nVidia fan, the cards (and motherboards) always came with SLI bridges.  Why isn't this the case with ATI?

Have you had a different experience?
