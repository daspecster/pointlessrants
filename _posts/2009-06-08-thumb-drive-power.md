When I started my summer internship about a month ago, I bought a thumb drive to use with the typically locked-down corporate workstation. I wanted to experiment with portable programs to see what I could to enhance my productivity. It's been interesting, but by far the most useful tool is PortablePython, which installs directly on the thumb drive. It comes packaged with more than I've installed on my personal computer. I've used it to automate a number of tasks, using <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a> to call batch files that run Python scripts which do text manipulation. I also found a pretty cool extension called <a href="http://www.rutherfurd.net/python/sendkeys/">SendKeys</a> which is a remake of an old VB script that sends keystrokes to the system.

What do <i>you</i> do with your thumb drive to make yourself more productive?
