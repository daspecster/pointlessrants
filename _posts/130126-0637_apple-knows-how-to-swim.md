Title: Apple knows how to swim.

I'm tired of seeing all these articles titled "Can a low-cost iPhone SAVE Apple?!?!?!", "Apple learns it has to work harder for it's money", "Can Tim Cook save Apple"...etc..etc.. That sentiment must be selling page views but really it's a pretty unintelligent view of the situation.
What's really happend to Apple this last quarter? Well...they had record profits! Yes the landscape of Apple is changing, just like it always had.

Apple is very good at making great products and entering new markets. This is a trend in Apple that I believe will continue even in a post Tim Cook era.  Apple does an excellent job at developing profitable products, they experiment a lot and they refine their products and even discontinue them.  They will continue to do this.

Also, if Apple didn't sell ANYTHING tomorrow...and the day after..and the next day...for a year and a half....they could. If that happened and you had that many Apple employees trying to figure out ways to make money...for a year...then they would probably emerge as the top company in whatever markets existed. Apple has enough money to absorb a lot of disruption in the tumultuous world of technology. As an investor, this should be a positive factor for you.

The next 5 years of tech will be a massive roller coaster, but Apple has weathered roller coasters before and will successfully weather more.

Apple has competition with Android now, and I think that will only push both companies to produce better products and Apple has generally performed will in a competitive environment.

I think regardless of the emotional view that the public has of Apple right now, Apple will continue to produce the highest quality of products that people love to use.
