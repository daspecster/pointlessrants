I'm really confused. So if someone can post a comment an explain where I'm crazy on this then please do!
So Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) was shown on some Asus tablets (<a title="The Inquirer Honeycomb tablets" href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1934980/android-honeycomb-tips-asus-tablets">http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1934980/android-honeycomb-tips-asus-tablets</a>) and there's some leaked music app out there (<a title="IntoMobile Android Honeycomb Music Player leaked" href="http://www.intomobile.com/2010/12/29/android-honeycomb-music-player-download/">http://www.intomobile.com/2010/12/29/android-honeycomb-music-player-download/</a>).  Cool right?  Well where did they get the source code for this? I don't see it? I can't find it? There's no updates for the SDK that contain the 3.0 API calls?

So Asus has some kind of special deal with Google to be able to get early access to the "open" platform which is dubbed "Android"?

Now I realize that I could be way off base here because I have not built the latest code in the Android GIT <a class="wikinvest-suggestion-link" articletype="definition" articletitle="UmVwbw,,_0" target="_blank" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Repo">repo</a>(<a title="Android Git repository" href="http://android.git.kernel.org">http://android.git.kernel.org</a>/). *Note the big <a class="wikinvest-suggestion-link" articletype="concept" articletitle="T3BlbiBTb3VyY2U,_0" target="_blank" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Open_Source">open source</a> logo at the top of that page.

So my question is where is Honeycomb for the rest of us?

UPDATE:

It seems that many Android devices don't play well with GPL.
