For those of you who want to argue that Google is doing just fine (<a href="http://www.daspecster.com/2009/02/episode-1/">ahem</a>), I refer you to some new articles on the subject. Google may not be in the trouble I originally blogged about, but <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2009/2/google-next-victim-of-creative-destruction-goog">this article</a> generalizes the difficulties it faces in terms of past internet giants like AOL, and <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2009/02/09/is-the-real-time-web-a-threat-to-google-search/">this article</a> reiterates the Twitter Threat discussed in the first article. As I recall, <a href="http://www.daspecster.com/2009/02/search-newegg-with-ubiquity/">somebody</a> and <a href="http://www.daspecster.com/2009/02/view-your-tasks-in-voo2do-with-ubiquity/">somebody else</a> have been writing Ubiquity scripts to let them search specific sites from any webpage. Dare I say it, but I think people are finding alternatives to searching with the Old Ways.

Tom's remarks about <a href="http://www.daspecster.com/2009/02/episode-1/">One Login to Rule Them All</a>, however, is still valid. I won't take that away from him.
