Tom has been skeptical of Python (I've never figured out why), but I now have something to change his mind. Last week I stumbled across <a href="http://vimeo.com/3548811">PyMT</a>, a cryptic name in which the last two letters stand for one of Tom's favorite subjects: <b>multi-touch</b>.

PyMT is in version 0.2 and it's built on <a href="http://www.pyglet.org/">pyglet</a>. There's <a href="http://pymt.txzone.net/post/2009/03/15/PyMT-Tutorial-2:-Your-first-PyMT-App!(-Making-it-a-Plugin)">one tutorial</a> that shows how easy it is to create a GUI with PyMT.

The one thing I'd like to do is get rid of the red dot that appears on clicking. It's meant to indicate a finger pushing on a multi-touch surface, but it would be nice to be able to make some simple apps without having a giant pimple appear under the cursor whenever one clicks. That said, the <a href="http://vimeo.com/3548811">multi-touch capabilities</a> are pretty impressive for v0.2

<b>Update:</b> There are some <a href="http://pymt.txzone.net/post/2009/06/30/New-videos-using-PyMT">videos</a> demonstrating the software. My personal favorite is the first one featuring the Dell XT2. Having a tablet (albeit not multi-touch), I could get some good out of the 36 lines of code running the app in the demo.
