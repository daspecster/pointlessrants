I came across <a href="http://www.leapfish.com/">LeapFish</a> this morning. It's a new search engine that promises to aggregate everything that's touted about the new web, web 2.0, real-time web, whatever you like to call it. While they have "an <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/leapfish_advertising_story.php">introductory video</a> that can only be described as epic," I think that LeapFish has a fundamental problem.

It's not that it's slow (it is, even when typing in the search box). The problem is that the term that comes to mind to describe it is not "search engine" but "distraction engine." The front page is littered with News, Celebrity News, Mashable, Popular Videos, Facebook, Twitter, Weather, and Deal of the Day. Ultimately, LeapFish shows me a bunch of things I don't care about, but will probably get distracted by anyway. I know where to find the things that I want, and at present I'm not interested in finding more things to do online just for the sake of doing things online.

The LeapFish video quotes Charles Darwin in observing that the organisms which survive are those that adapt fastest to change. I take a much more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)">Boyd</a>-like approach when it comes to people: he who <b>makes</b> the change survives. If businesses are trying to keep up, they've already lost. This is why no one has yet become a Google-killer: Google changes the game faster than others do; that's how they stay on top. I remember watching Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail play catch-up with GMail's storage and archiving capabilities. Google constantly innovates, changing the game, not playing catch-up. If LeapFish thinks it's ahead of the curve because it adapts fast, it's already lost to those who are creating the change it's adapting to.
