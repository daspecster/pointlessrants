I came across an interesting program today called <a title="f.lux" href="http://www.stereopsis.com/flux/">f.lux</a>.  You configure it with your latitude/longitude and lighting settings and then it will manipulate the colors of your monitor to change with the time of day in your geographical area.

I've heard multiple reports that this will help you sleep better at night if you're a regular late night computer user and the makers of f.lux have some research information <a title="f.lux research" href="http://www.stereopsis.com/flux/research.html">here</a>.  I haven't been sleeping too well lately so I'm giving it a shot.  Let us know in the comments how it works for you.
