With no time for a proper introduction, allow me then to share a brand new jQuery plugin for your enjoyment -- <a href="https://github.com/akoimeexx/jQuery-Viewie-Plugin" target="_blank">Viewie</a>!

Viewie for jQuery was written in response to the plethora of Lightbox-clone plugins that all do the same thing: They open a modal window, darken (or otherwise hide) the original page, and show you the content in the modal window. Everybody and their uncle has written a lightbox clone now, and I have yet to find the one that just lets me make my own choices.

Gone is the modal window! Gone are external style dependencies like images and stylesheets! Viewie has two dependencies. jQuery and jQuery UI. If you're any web developer worth your salt you're using these already so now your dependency listing just dropped to nil. So go ahead, check out Viewie now!

You can find Viewie in these great locations¹:
