As of earlier today Sony announced that PSN - PlayStation Network would begin to be <a title="PlayStation Network restored" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/05/14/play-on-%E2%80%93-psn-restoration-begins-now/">restored </a>.
There is an <a title="PlayStation Outage Update" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/05/14/ps3-system-software-update/">update</a> that Sony wants you to download which will require you to change your password.
It's been 24 days since the outage began. Some suspect that the so called "hacker" group "Anonymous" was responsible but Anonymous claims the action to be rogue and that they are not involved.

Regardless of the direct or indirect involvement of Anonymous, I have to say that Sony's response time clearly indicates a serious structural issue with their network and systems.
