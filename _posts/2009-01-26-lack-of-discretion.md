Well, Tom has suckered me into joining the blog. I tried blogging once, but it's hard to keep the momentum going when you're posting about offshoot/hybrid philosophy. Fortunately, this time it's up to Tom to keep the momentum going. I'll probably be posting about operating systems, Python, and because I first learned to program on a Commodore 64, I'll probably be looking for old (really old) computers still active in the wild. For instance, I know of at least one water treatment plant that monitors arsenic levels with an Atari.
<!--more--><h3>A Comment on Operating Systems</h3>
For starters, I am somewhat critical of pretty much all operating systems. Actually, not so much the operating systems themselves as much as their interfaces. For me, they are all more or less the same graphically, which doesn't seem to matter to most people. It matters to me because I have a tablet pc (a Toshiba Satellite R15 that's about three years old). I have not really found an operating system that makes me want to use it as a tablet. I've used it for taking notes in math classes, but haven't done much in terms of daily usage.

Consequently, my eyes have been opened when it comes to interface design. I haven't found much online about innovating interfaces, and so I guess I'll have to step out and make a few remarks myself.

Thus, you can expect a few...

Pointless Rants.
