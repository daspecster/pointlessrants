Yeah that's right! In case you hadn't noticed we have an Android application!
I wrote it a while ago just to learn a little about the Android platform. It was a good learning experience and I think I can really expand it if I have the time.

I would also like to develop an <a class="wikinvest-suggestion-link" articletype="concept" articletitle="SVBob25l_0" target="_blank" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/IPhone">iPhone</a> and Windows Phone 7 version as well, but time and resources are limited. I have been thinking about releasing the source code for the application, so if you're interested in developing it further let me know.  I currently have it hosted on bitbucket.org but it is a private repository.

Here's somethings I would like to add...
<ul>
	<li>Tabbed content for podcasts/screencasts.</li>
	<li>Notification of posts/podcasts</li>
	<li>Better navigation of categories and tags</li>
	<li>Search</li>
</ul>
Here's the link and QR code!

Click to download: <a href="market://details?id=com.pointlessrants.rss">Pointless Rants Android App</a>

<a href="market://details?id=com.pointlessrants.rss"></a> It's very simple for now, simply an rss reader directed to the site.

I hope to expand the content of the site and bring the app along with the expansion.

That is our goal this year.  Anyway, enjoy and thanks for stopping by!
