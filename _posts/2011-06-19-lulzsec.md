In the last few months Lulzsecurity has been making quite an impact on security and the news. Their tactic has been to raise awareness for the lulz of it. For LulzSec's 1000th tweet the wrote a <a title="Lulzsecurity 1000th tweet" href="http://lulzsecurity.com/releases/1000th_tweet_press_release.txt">press release</a> that outlines some of the mentality that they have.

To peer into the psyche of a hacker is almost always a unique experience.  This one post is all the time I will give LulzSec on my blog. Because I believe that they're tactic is wrong. What they are doing is exciting to watch but extremely destructive to the people that they say they are defending.  Their actions follow closely to the definition of "<a title="define lulz on google" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Alulz">lulz</a>", which aligns close to what many call "The Hacker Manifesto" written by "The Mentor" in 1986. The article is called "<a title="The Conscience of a Hacker - The Mentor" href="http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=7&amp;id=3&amp;mode=txt">The Conscience of a Hacker</a>".

Hacking is an interesting term that I think is improperly defined in most dictionaries. There was a documentary where I believe one hacker defined "hacking" as "making something do something that was unintended or not foreseen by the creator". I think that is far more accurate than the definitions that I found in dictionaries.

LulzSec may be hacking for the lulz of it and they realize that their time is probably drawing to a close but something we should all ask our selves is "What did we learn from this?".

Maybe LulzSec should have released their exploits to the companies that were expose so that they could secure their systems and push back the fix to the rest of the world. Maybe LulzSec should have done a lot of different things different.
