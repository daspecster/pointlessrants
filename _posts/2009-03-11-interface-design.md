I stumbled across a <a href="http://www.asktog.com/basics/firstPrinciples.html">website on interface design</a> this evening. It has some good points that deserve to be implemented more often than they have been so far.

I'm especially a fan of implementing Fitts's law, though I haven't thought about it quite the same way it's presented <a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/022DesignedToGiveFitts.html">here</a>.
