Since I never get enough legalese from reading corporate documents on a daily basis, I've resorted to reading documentation that our wise <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">patent office</a> publishes.  They're pretty good about granting patents that stimulate intellectual growth and collaboration rather than hindering it as well as only granting patents for very unique, distinct concepts.  When it comes to technology, they never grant patents to the undeserving.  Which is why it makes complete sense that <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20091111094923390">the patent office granted Microsoft a patent on sudo</a>.  Microsoft just deserved a go at some of the fun after the UNIX/Linux crowd had their way with sudo for 30 or 40 years.

And for the readers of Pointless Rants that don't know me too well yet... &lt;/sarcasm&gt;.   :mrgreen:
