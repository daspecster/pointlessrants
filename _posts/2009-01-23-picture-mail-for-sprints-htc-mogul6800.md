At 5:01 PM EST today I recieved a text message from Sprint on my phone.
<blockquote>SPRINTFREEMSG: Picture Mail is now available for your device at <a href="http://softwarestore.sprint.com/wap ">http://softwarestore.sprint.com/wap</a> under the Free/Demo section. Click Go to get it now.</blockquote>
This is great news!  This feature has been too long been missing from these "more powerful" Windows Mobile phones.

I downloaded the CAB file and installed it. When I went to send a picture message I received a G66 error code and was told to register my phone. It turns out that you must be in a service area in order to send the picture mail.  I was using my WiFi and was thus, not in a service area (AKA No signal at all...none...ZERO).   So make sure that if you want to send picture mail then you need to have signal and you can't use your awesome WiFi that your phone has.

The HTC Mogul from Sprint was missing MMS from it's release on June 18th 2007, and the feature of picture messaging wasn't available for it's predecessor (HTC PPC-6700) either.

There were options with these phones to send pictures via email however direct MMS capability has been severely lacking for a long time. There was an MMS program that Sprint released in the beginning of 2006  (<a href="http://www.sprintusers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=88426">http://www.sprintusers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=88426</a>), however this was only semi-functional and wasn't maintained as far as I know.

Sprint has also released this software for other phones as well..
<ul>
	<li>Samsung ACE</li>
	<li>HTC Mogul</li>
	<li>HTC Touch</li>
	<li>Motorola Q9c</li>
	<li>Palm Treo 800w</li>
</ul>
If you have these phones and are paying for picture messaging on your phone plan then download this application!

<em>Also, while I'm talking about the HTC PPC-6800, I would like to say that my little green call button has stopped functioning for some reason. I google'd around and it seems that many HTC PPC-6800 users are experiencing the same thing.  I've had mine about a year and it's seen moderate use.  My boss has the same phone and it's a few months older and the same exact thing has happened with the call button.  Just a little heads up to HTC PPC-6800 owners. </em>
