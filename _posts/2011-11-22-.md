<p>I am a huge tech hardware enthusiast . So naturally I absolutely love Newegg.com. But what I love even more than the latest tech hardware is saving money on tech hardware. When Newegg started their daily deal section called “SHELL SHOCKER,” which offers deals some times up to 66% off, I made it a point to check their website every day. What made it even better is when they started having multiple Shell Shockers every day. Then I made it a point to check their website shortly after each new item was presented to make sure I didn’t miss out on a good deal. The suspense and wonder of what was coming next kept me coming back, but then they took it a step too far.</p>
<p>Now when you log onto the Newegg website you are able to see all of the upcoming Shell Shockers for the day you are just unable to see how much each item will be discounted. So now instead of checking their website several times a day I'm now only checking it once in the morning and then maybe once more if I'm interested in one of the items. The only one benefit of the updated Shell Shocker section is that you can now go back and purchase items from earlier in the day, if they haven’t sold out. It just leaves me wondering what Newegg was trying to accomplish. For me personally the updated Shell Shocker section has reduced the number of times that I check Newegg throughout the day and which has resulted in me not spending as much time looking at parts and dreaming about my next build. I'm not sure that this is what Newegg was trying to accomplish but I haven’t purchased anything from them in months.</p>
