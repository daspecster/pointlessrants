Here is a list of linux commands and files that have information that I found interesting or useful.

<!--more-->
<ul>
	<li>w - this command shows you information about who is logged in</li>
	<li>dig domain.com - this gathers information about a domain name</li>
	<li>nslookup domain.com - Query DNS servers for information about domain names</li>
	<li>whois domain.com - Ancient command to find out more information about DNS</li>
	<li>cat file.txt - You can use this to join  split avi files together ($ cat avimovie_part* &gt; newavimovie_whole.avi ) or just to view the contents of a file</li>
	<li>du  * - find the disk usage of a file or a directory ( I recommend using the -ch switch for outputting a total and making that total human readable)</li>
	<li>df - Disk freespace, pretty much self explaining but I use it with the -h switch to convert the bytes to megabytes or gigabytes</li>
	<li>tail file.txt  - This shows you the last bit that was appended to a file. I use this with the -f switch to "follow" a file as it's updated live</li>
	<li>finger username - find information about users</li>
	<li>sudo command - gain root privileges for the commends you're using</li>
</ul>
Feel free to comment and add the commands that you find interesting.
