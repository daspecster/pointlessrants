I've known about this project for some time, but I had to bring it up after I watched a few YouTube videos after work.  I accidentally read some of the comments below the videos and <span style="text-decoration: line-through">my eyes started burning</span> it made me remember <a title="StupidFilter" href="http://stupidfilter.org/main/index.php?n=Main.HomePage">StupidFilter</a>.

StupidFilter is essentially a spam or junk filter but for stupid text.  If you play around with the <a title="demo" href="http://stupidfilter.org/demo.php">demo</a>, you can see how it works.  If you like pain, you can check the <a title="random page" href="http://stupidfilter.org/random.php">random page</a> to see all of the random comments StupidFilter has stored in their database thus far.

I can't help but think how useful StupidFilter would be to Google and YouTube.  While Google must use  a large amount of storage for inane response videos, the text comments that get stored must use a decent amount of storage at YouTube's scale too.  It would save Google money and it would make YouTube comments easier on the eyes.
