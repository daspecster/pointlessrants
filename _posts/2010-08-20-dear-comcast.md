<blockquote>Dear COMCAST,

During a recent review of my experience, an error was found in my judgment. This error has resulted in me being a Comcast customer at a rate inappropriate for my level of service. My last billing statement arrived as a slap in the face with monthly charges inappropriate for the Comcast Unpredictable Speed Internet Service I am receiving.

If you have any questions concerning the cancellation of my account, please contact me and I will be happy to assist you.

I apologize for the patronage of your business that this error in judgment has caused. I would appreciate some actual customer service and I shudder to think how much I would be paying if I was actually the loyal Comcast customer you accuse me of being.

Sincerely,

One Disatisfied Customer</blockquote>

All kidding aside, $70 per month is too much to pay for internet service for two people. I felt like it was too much when it was $40 considering the sort of internet performance I've been getting. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to have a direct sales representative who got me a better rate (only to disappear into thin air and leave an alleged replacement named Brenda) and that when Comcast discovered the better rate they leapt into action and, naturally, "corrected the error". Of course, I received a corrected bill informing me&mdash;to my surprise&mdash;that my internet service had been discontinued at the expected rate and restarted at a much higher rate. A week and a half later I received a letter informing me of this "correction" and saying that my next billing statement would reflect the higher rates. I hate to think they mean there's another rate hike coming after I've already had two in the last two months.

To add insult to injury, they actually did accuse me of being a loyal Comcast customer (someone apparently thinks they can pull off the Jedi mind trick). Listen, Comcast, I reluctantly signed up with you&mdash;despite my better judgment&mdash;because AT&T did not offer DSL service to my apartment at the time. Guess what? Now they do, and considering the excellent customer service I received from AT&T in the past, I will be cancelling my account with Comcast and signing up with AT&T (not to mention recommending the same to every person with whom I cross paths).

In short, Comcast, if you're going to succeed, you should be either cheap or convenient. When you're neither and you're still in business, it starts to raise eyebrows and the next thing you know you have an investigation into anti-trust violations. Enjoy.
