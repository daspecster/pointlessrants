<h1>Search Engine</h1>
We use search engines every day, some times whether we know it or not. Ask anyone what search engines they know and <a title="Google Inc." href="http://www.google.com">Google.com</a> will most likely be at the top of the list along with <a title="Yahoo Inc." href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo.com</a> and now <a title="Microsoft Bing" href="http://www.bing.com">Bing.com</a>.

These companies make a lot of money and employ a lot of people these days(<a title="Google Stock Ticker" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:GOOG&amp;fstype=ii">GOOG</a>, <a title="Yahoo Stock Ticker" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:YHOO&amp;fstype=ii">YHOO</a>, <a title="Microsoft Stock Ticker" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:MSFT&amp;fstype=ii">MSFT</a>). They have been the kings of their hill for a while now. They have been unchallenged and some undefeated. It might be time for things to change.

Lately a lot of little search engines have been popping up, <a title="Blekko Search Engine" href="http://www.blekko.com">blekko.com</a> and <a title="DuckDuckGo Search Engine" href="http://www.duckduckgo.com">duckduckgo.com</a> in this case.  I think these search engines have the same spirit that Google had when it was first starting out. Google just wanted to be a little bit better than it's competition and when they were rejected they set off on their own. Providing users with search results that were slightly more accurate than their competition was enough to earn them the spot they're in today.

So the question is, "How long until they are dethroned"?

That time might not be so distant in the future.
<h2>Blekko and DuckDuckGo Merge!</h2>
<h3><a title="Blekko and DuckDuckGo Merge" href="http://www.skrenta.com/2010/11/blekko_partners_with_duckduckg.html">http://www.skrenta.com/2010/11/blekko_partners_with_duckduckg.html</a></h3>
These two search engines each provide some simple to use and unique features that can help users find the information that they're looking for.
<blockquote>So I'm pleased to announce blekko's first search partnership, with fellow search startup<a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>. When DuckDuckGo users search on a term which matches one of blekko's seven auto-fired slashtag categories, DuckDuckGo users <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=cure+for+headaches">will see results</a> from blekko. (The seven auto-fired slashtag categories are <a href="http://blekko.com/ws/+%2Fhealth">health</a>, <a href="http://blekko.com/ws/+%2Fcolleges">colleges</a>, <a href="http://blekko.com/ws/+%2Fautos">autos</a>, <a href="http://blekko.com/ws/+%2Fmoney">personal finance</a>, <a href="http://blekko.com/ws/+%2Flyrics">lyrics</a>, <a href="http://blekko.com/ws/+%2Frecipes">recipes</a>and <a href="http://blekko.com/ws/+%2Fhotels">hotels</a>.</blockquote>
So now you can use some of blekko's "slashtags"!
<blockquote>As part of this partnership Blekko users will have access to DuckDuckGo’s "Zero-Click Info" on a site-by-site basis. Zero-Click Info helps users find the most relevant information on sites and search terms without having to click on search results.</blockquote>
And you can use DuckDuckGo's "Zero-Click Info" solutions!

Google has been releasing features a lot lately and it's funny because it seems like they've been just throwing stuff against the wall and seeing what sticks. If this is true then Google is in a whole lot of trouble. Because these smaller search engine companies have much less over-head and seem to care much more about their users.

I don't think there's been enough competition in the search engine market and I'm very glad to see <a title="DuckDuckGo Search Engine" href="http://www.duckduckgo.com">duckduckgo.com </a>and <a title="Blekko search engine" href="http://www.blekko.com">blekko.com</a> joining forces.
