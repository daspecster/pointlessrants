So a friend at work showed me this article on <a title="MacRumors Apple and AMD" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/04/16/apple-considering-adopting-amd-processors-for-upcoming-macs/">macrumors.com</a> today. It talks about Apple potentially looking to AMD for their next processor line up, due to Intel's production shortcomings.

Now that's interesting, AMD has been in Intel's shadow for a long time and it would be great to see them get something good going again. It would be huge if Apple decided to use AMD processors in their computers. AMD has ATI which has been making great budget graphics cards.  AMD also has a really decent platform for their CPUs right now. While both Intel and AMD are screaming about hex-a-cores there appear to be some differences between the platforms that Apple could indulge in. For example, AMD's processors appear to use less power. This would be huge for laptops and cooling issues.

So here is what I think...

<span style="font-size: large;">Apple should buy AMD.</span>

I think it would just make sense and be a benefit to both companies. Apple could then have in-house CPU and GPU production and they wouldn't have to worry about production delays. They would also have the ability to have their hand in the development of new CPU/GPU platforms which they have already  expressed an interest in by purchasing <a title="P.A. Semi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.A._Semi">P.A. Semi</a> for the development of the A4 chip in the iPad.

Apple would have the ability to really open up their creativity for a bargain price!

AMD's market cap is $6 Billion...that's just 1 quarter's revenue for Apple ($223 Billion market cap).  Of course, I'm using these numbers wrong, but I just want to put into scale the difference in the sizes of the companies.

So these thoughts have really made me wonder, "What was AMD <em>really</em> doing at the ApplePlex?"
