<p class="MsoNormal">Working in IT support I have run into this problem several times. Faculty and friends have brought me their crippled computers crying for help. I have tried several different ways of removing the dreaded “Antivirus 2009 or 360” and none of them compare to removing it with MalwareBytes. MalwareBytes is a free anti-malware scanner that removes all of the registry entries, startup shortcuts, etc. associated with Antivirus 2009 or 360. There also is a premium version of the software but if you’re looking for a quick fix I highly recommend MalwareBytes. Visit <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> to download their software and “Destroy Malware, one byte at a time.”</p>
