title: 'Easily See System Info'

My last post was about one way to save time in Firefox.  I think posting about ways to save time is going to be a common topic for me.  Here's a way to save time when trying to gather technical information about a machine.

If you work on many systems that can be similar, a tool like <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897557.aspx">BgInfo</a> would help a lot.  BgInfo rewrites the wallpaper image to contain lots of useful technical information.  The information it contains is highly customizable.  And the best part: because BgInfo just rewrites the wallpaper image and isn't constantly running, it doesn't use any system resources.
