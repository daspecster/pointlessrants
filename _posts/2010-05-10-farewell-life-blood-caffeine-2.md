Caffeine is a staple in computing and nerdom. ThinkGeek.com for example has tons of <a title="ThinkGeek Caffine" href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/whereisit.cgi?t=caffeine">caffeine products</a>! Everything from caffeinated soap to mugs with the caffeine molecule on them.

Why does caffeine have such a following in the tech community? Well it could have to do with how caffeine works.

Caffeine helps your brain continue to work when it's fatigued(which only makes it more fatigued later), it will appear to speed up your brain if you have caffeine while you are rested.

Why does this appeal to nerds and geeks? Well we want to be unstoppable.Â  Some may object to that but really think about it. When you're working on something and it's getting late or early as the case usually is, you don't want to go sleep and wait until tomorrow! You want to keep working on whatever it is that is catching your attention at the moment!

I too have this egotistical delusion, but I'm trying to drastically cut back.

Why am I doing this? Well part of it is that I hit a point in my life that we all hit or live at continually. The point is that I realized I have been using caffeine as a crutch to get me through each day.

Also, I hit that wall where caffeine wasn't doing the trick any more and I was still tired and I was drinking caffeine from 1pm-4pm just to remain concious.

I have been fortunate that I usually encounter no issues with headaches once I stopped having caffeine.

When I stop drinking caffeine in crutch format, as well as attempt to get sleep, eat bettter and exercise I find a lot of good things happening.

I find that I have more energy, I feel more positive, it's not as easy to tweak me and over all things just feel and seem better.

I highly recommend dropping caffeine for a couple weeks and seeing if you notice a difference or not.
