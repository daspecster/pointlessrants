Well this isn't really tech oriented but it was just something that's currently happening.

<a title="Jesse James Hollywood" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_James_Hollywood">Jesse James Hollywood</a> is pretty much indirectly responsible for the death of <a title="Murder of Nicholas Markowitz" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Nicholas_Markowitz">Nicholas Markowitz</a> in August 2000.  A friend of Jesse James Hollywood owed Jesse some money and was allegedly told that by murdering Nicholas Markowitz(the brother of another guy that owed Jesse Money) that his debt would be forgotten.  Jesse James Hollywood fled the country in 2000 and wasn't found until 2005.  Most of the individuals involved were around 20 years old.

It's really sad that people so young made so many bad decisions.  In any case Jesse James Hollywood is having his trial April 27th of this year. I hope that justice is served, however I think we might see an example of the corruption in the court system with this one.  We shall see...

This story is the basis of the movie <a title="Alpha Dog" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426883/">Alpha Dog</a> that was released in 2006.
