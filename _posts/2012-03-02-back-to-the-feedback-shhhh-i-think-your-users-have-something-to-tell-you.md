<strong>The Feedback:</strong>

Millions of people visit websites on a daily basis, they search, share links with each other and verbally exchange exciting sites they have found. Have you ever visited a website and then told a friend, "That was the worst site I've ever been to!"? Wouldn't it be nice if the visitor had told <em>you</em> what they didn't like instead of just telling their friends? You might think, "Yeah! That'd be nice, but people don't just give out that information freely". Well, I've found they actually will tell you. There's a catch, but it's not as bad as you might be thinking.

<strong>The Catch:</strong>

Low barrier to entry.

That's it. Have you ever gone to a website and found a problem or had a question, then noticed a feedback button, only to be greeted with a login page that was asking you to sign up and commit to a membership to some site? I don't want to become a member of some other site to leave feedback at the one I'm currently visiting, and I really doubt your visitors are willing to do that either.

So what can you do? Um, <em>don't ask them to sign up for anything</em>. Â Reduce the barrier to entry by just letting your users/visitors send you a note.

<strong>The Result:</strong>

You might be thinking "Well, if I don't ask for their email address then how can I respond to them??". First of all, you might be assuming that they want you to respond to them. If you're responding to people and they aren't sending you a second communication then chances are you're not getting much worth out of your initial response to them. Now the interesting thing that I've observed is that if people really want to work out a problem/issue/praise with you then they will put that contact information in the feedback. In those cases, there is usually dialog that happens and is extremely valuable for both the user and the site owner. Thus, building a relationship that the user will tell others about. What everyone wants is for their users to tell other people how awesome their site/product or the person they interacted with was.
