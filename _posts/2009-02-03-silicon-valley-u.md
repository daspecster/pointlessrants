There's been some buzz the last few days about a future Silicon Valley university. As good an idea as that is, my question is how long Silicon Valley can last in California. The state already has higher taxes than almost anywhere else in the U.S. and it's still broke (that's right: expect taxes to go up).

The rich may be able to afford life in California, but in these economic times, not every developer has deep enough pockets to survive on the Left Coast. Should the computer center of the world migrate to more friendly territory?
