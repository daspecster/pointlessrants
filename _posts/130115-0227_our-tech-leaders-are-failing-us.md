Title: Our Tech Leaders Are Failing Us
Date: 2013-01-15 02:27 

2012 was interesting. I saw a lot of companies that I once viewed as tech leaders produce flops. We've seen a simple map app bring a giant to it's knees (Apple).  Another tech mammoth, Microsoft, has been floundering in almost all of it's markets. In the past we've seen RIM, Nokia, AMD, and many others falter. 

So what this has meant for me is that I haven't gotten very excited about anything I've seen from these guys. I was excited about the iPhone 5 but iOS 6 was missing a lot of features that I'd like to see. Even Android with all it's craziness isn't all that exciting to me. I'd like to see mobile applications really expand so I can do more cool stuff, but I'll talk about that in a minute.

So while I've not been excited by the big players, there have been a lot of things happening on the side that have been very interesting. Mostly in the realm of services and applications.

So it's a bit late in the article but here's my argumentative thesis statement...

Consumers are accustomed to their hardware, which makes them hard to impress. This will turn focus on application development and services to produce consumer surprise and excitement.

Google, has intensely revamped *Google Maps* and people loved it. I would be extremely surprised if Apple had anywhere near the number of man hours spent on iOS's maps app compared to Google.

Apple did a great job with migrating their iWork apps to mobile. I'd really like to see a major update to those soon. 

I guess my thought is that companies need to start investing more in their apps to excite their customers. People want more capability and higher quality in the things they use daily. iPhones are still the pinnacle of phone hardware and Android handset manufactures are catching up. They're both *good enough* what I think people want now is great applications that positively affect their lives.
