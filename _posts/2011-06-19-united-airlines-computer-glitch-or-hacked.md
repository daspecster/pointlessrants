In case you were flying United Airlines on Friday the 17th, you may have noticed the United Airlines staff were a bit frantic.

<cite title="Business Week" lang="English">United said its flight departures, airport processing and reservation system, including its website, were affected by the outage.

My question is simply this...hacked? or did a squirrel chew through the fiber again?
