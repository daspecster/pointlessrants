title: 'SparkFun''s Free Day'

---

I've only been watching their site for a few months now, but everything I see over at <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/categories.php">SparkFun Electronics</a> gets me excited.  I've got so much of their stuff on my Christmas list I should invest in their company.

And, since I like you guys so much, I'm going to head out on the proverbial limb and risk my shot at SparkFun's Free Day, and share it with you guys in case you haven't heard about it yet.  SparkFun is going to be giving away $100 worth of stuff on January 7th (you pay shipping) until time's up or they hit $100k worth of free stuff.  Head on over to their post about it if you're interested: <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/news.php?id=305">Free Day is January 7th, 2010!</a>
