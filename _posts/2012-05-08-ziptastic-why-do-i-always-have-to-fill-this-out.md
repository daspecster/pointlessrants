<h2>We all do it.</h2>
We've all used paper to register for something, write an address on an envelope or pay taxes. We've all gotten to that part at the bottom where they want you to write down your City, State, Zip and even sometimes country. Many of us do this a lot throughout life. I've always thought that seemed like a ton of redundant information, but you know it makes sense, it's paper and not dynamic so fine.

Then I started registering for things on websites, my jaw dropped to the floor, I STILL have to fill out all these fields! Can't I just fill out my zip code and call it a day?
<h2>I FIX IT!</h2>
This may seem silly but filling out these fields on the web really bothered me. So I've decided to do something about it.
<h3>Enter <a title="Ziptastic" href="http://daspecster.github.com/ziptastic">Ziptastic!</a></h3>
Ziptastic isn't so much a free service as it is an <em>idea</em>.  I wanted to demonstrate a way to reduce the barrier to entry to your service by forcing the user to fill out fewer form fields.  Anyone can fork this code and setup their own database and use it. My only goal is for internet users to not have to spend millions/billions of extra keystrokes and extra time filling out those fields in webforms.  To some of the people that have already implemented Ziptastic or some derivative...I THANK YOU!

P.S. Just so you know, you should expect a lot more cool things from us at <a title="eleven base two blog" href="http://blog.elevenbasetwo.com">eleven<sub>2</sub></a> in the future.

Thanks again everyone! Keep making the web better!
