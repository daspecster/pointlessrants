There's a device I'd really like to see: a USB multitouch screen. The way I envision it, it would be something like a thin iPad with a USB cable that you can just plug into any computer. You could instantly have a multitouch screen for any computer!

Sure, you'd sacrifice the mobility of a full-fledged tablet, but being able to turn your laptop or desktop into a multitouch device on whim would be very useful. Add to that the fact that you could run a full-fledged operating system on it, software without the limitations of iOS or Android (as portable as they may be, I'm not going to code on them).

As far as I know, no such device exists. If you know of one, tell me where I can find it in the comments. If you know how to make one (or you have a few ideas on where to start), let me know that too. After all: if you can't buy it, make it.
