I have recently changed the podcast URL to http://feeds2.feedburner.com/PointlessRantsPodcast.  The site RSS will still contain the podcasts but if you want only the podcasts then this new feed is the one you want.  I'm trying to make this transition as fluid as possible. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I will post more details on this later as I get time.  I would like to write up a post describing the process so others can learn from my mistakes!
