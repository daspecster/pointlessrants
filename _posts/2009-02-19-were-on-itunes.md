Ok, now I'm not especially a fan of iTunes but it's decent enough and has a lot of users.   So, for our podcasts to be published on itunes is very exciting!  I'll be watching the google analytics to see if there's any spike in traffic.  At very least this will be a good experiement!

Thanks,  iTunes,  for quickly approving the podcast!
