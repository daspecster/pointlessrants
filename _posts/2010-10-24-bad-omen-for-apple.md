There's been quite a bit of tech news over the last week, among it <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/208172/steve_jobs_unloads_on_ipad_competitors.html?tk=hp_new">Steve Jobs' rant</a> to investors about Android's inferiority to the iPhone operating system. The rant came during a conference call with Apple investors that was originally intended to explain poorer than expected performance over the last quarter. Many have pointed out that poorer than expected performance from Apple has a lot more to do with high expectations than objectively poor performance; it's clear that Apple is doing very well. It's new iPhone sold more than expected (despite quite a lot of bad press with antennas and cracking glass) and while the company sold fewer than expected iPads, the problem was on the manufacturing side, not the demand side. With all that in mind, a number of people have asked the question, "What is Steve Jobs complaining about?"

Even Steve Jobs' detractors rarely claim that he doesn't think ahead. He might be arrogant and controlling, but he's visionary. That said, I wonder if Jobs' foresight has let him see something that makes him want to rant about Android. I doubt that he thinks it's a better platform or that it's more popular, and the only other aspect up for grabs is the ecosystem, which brings me to what I think is really getting to Steve Jobs: <b>a drop in the number of iPhone developers.</b>

I don't have any evidence that there is such a drop, but it wouldn't surprise me if there was and it might explain a lot about Steve Jobs' rant last week.

On the other hand, he might just have been having a bad day.
