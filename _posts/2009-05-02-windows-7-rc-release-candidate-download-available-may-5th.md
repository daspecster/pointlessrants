Yup, the title pretty much says it all.  Oh what? You want to know where you can download it from?  Well  unless you have a MSDN or TechNet Plus subscription you're going to have to wait until May 5th to get your hands on the RC.  Here's the links!

If you're an MSDN subscriber then click <a title="Windows 7 RC Download" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/downloads/default.aspx?pv=36:350">here</a>!

If you're a TechNet Plus subscriber then click <a title="Windows 7 RC Download" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/downloads/default.aspx?pv=36:350">here</a>!

Everyone else can just wait until May 5th and then goto these websites.

Now, if this whole process seems just a little too complicated to make it worth the trouble then I HIGHLY suggest going  to <a title="Download Ubuntu to relieve your Microsoft stress!" href="http://www.ubuntu.com">www.ubuntu.com</a> and trying that out!
