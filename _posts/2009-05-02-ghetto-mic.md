When Tom first suggested to me that we <em>actually</em> do a podcast instead of just talking about it, I went out to buy a headset.  In India there aren't a large selection of electronics stores to pick from, so I had a friend take me around the town nearby (Hosur) and we eventually found a little shop that sold a "Zippy's" headset (it's a popular brand here in India).  The headset seemed to work in the store when he let me try it and it was only $5 (Rs. 250) so I bought it.

After taking it home, it worked great.  I used it for a couple of skype calls - with Tom and my sister and even used it for some language-learning on <a href="http://livemocha.com">livemocha.com</a>.  Then, one day, inexplicably, the microphone stopped working altogether.  I messed with it for a while but was unable to get it to work.  I was quite frustrated - tried to take it back to no avail, prayed about it (thinking of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20kings%206:1-7&amp;version=31">this verse</a>), and tried messing with it a bit to see if it was a bad connection.  Nothing worked.  All this and I hadn't even gotten to do my first podcast with the microphone.

So, despite my best efforts to have a nice microphone, I have done all of my podcast recording with a set of earbud headphones that I got with my creative zen touch a long time ago.  That's right, headphones are perfectly functional as microphones (at least the left side of stereo headphones, anyway).  In fact, I've come up with a pretty cool although sketchy setup where I rubber-band the headphones to the boom of my headset.  It's ghetto, it's geeky, but it works.<a href="http://www.daspecster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dscf0573.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-414" title="Ghetto mic pic" src="http://www.daspecster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dscf0573.jpg" alt="Ghetto mic pic" /></a>
