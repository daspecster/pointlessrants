The last few weeks many <a href="http://www.mint.com" title="Mint Financial">Mint.com</a> users have had an issue where they could not sync with <a href="http://www.53.com" title="Fifth Third Bank">Fifth Third Bank</a>.

I posted on Mint.com's <a title="Mint.com's Get Satisfaction" href="http://satisfaction.mint.com/mint/topics/why_wont_my_account_sync_with_fifth_third_bank?utm_content=topic_link&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=reply_notification">Get Satisfaction</a> page and it appears that there's quite a few people that have this issue as well. Once I figured out a solution I posted it there as well.

Well after a few emails between Mint.com and Fifth Third, there has been a solution that works for me.
<blockquote>If you visit the Service Center at the top of the web page after you have logged in and can view your accounts, you will see four groups of options. Please select the "Change Security Questions" option within the "Security Center" section. Updating your security questions will restore service to Mint.com.</blockquote>
I received this from Fifth Third after I had given them 5 days to fix the issue or I would leave the bank.

I think the issue was that Fifth Third had updated their security and not notified any one that they had done so. So if you hadn't setup the new security questions for your account then when Mint.com attempted to authenticate and pull your data the connection would fail.
