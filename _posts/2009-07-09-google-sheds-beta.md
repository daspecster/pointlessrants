In what was most likely a strategic business move, Google has shed the Beta tag off of their Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar, and Google Talk applications. The tag of shame has most likely been removed so that they will appear more attractive to businesses who pay $50 a year per user to use these applications.

Dropping the Beta tag off of these applications is more than just a way to appear more attractive to businesses it's also a step that must be taken before the Chrome OS is released in the second half of 2010. The OS will be released for netbooks and will be aimed toward the average user who surfs the web, writes email, or edits documents all of which can be on online with Google products.
