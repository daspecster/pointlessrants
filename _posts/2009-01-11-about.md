This website was started on January 11th 2009 during my last semester in college.   My roommate and I always end up having, what we consider, interesting conversations.  I'm in school with people that are very bright and any conversation with them always turns out to have very stimulating banter(Well, most of the time....ok some of the time).

This site is a chance for us to share our experiences and opinions with you!  And we would love to hear from you via comments or emails as well!
