Contrary to what you might think from the sarcastic title, I'm not going to totally bash Apple with my pointless opinion.

Apple has proven itself to be a successful company in recent history and I believe it's good to look at some of the odd things in a successful company.

When I say "odd" it kind of means not following the broad path or something that sets them apart from the rest of their competition.

One thing that is "odd" to be about Apple is their seemingly defiant resistance against user testing. The part that's hard to pin down here(or maybe not) is that they seem to do very little user testing during development and yet their products have some of the best design and usability in their industry.  So that's odd to me.

Google on the other hand does a lot of usability testing but their products aren't so easy to use(adwords, adsense just to name a few) and they're still successful.

So if Apple doesn't do a whole lot of user testing then what feedback do they have on their product design and how do they know what to do to improve it?

Johnathan Ive leads the direction of Apple's design and usability. He appears  to follow mainly design principles and people's psychology in deciding the development of a product.
Everything down to the material that is used in a product. So in that case Johnathan Ive is almost the product sculptor at Apple.

<h2>My conclusion:</h2>
It appears that Apple simply tries to follow sound design principles as well as continually trying to keep pace with the present and future cultures interaction with technology.

Now we all know that Apple has an interesting outlook an design and usability.  I wish I could find some quotes from Apple or Steve Jobs about this because I seem to remember in some movie that

Apple has an interesting outlook on product design and usability.
