If you've been following the steam store at all this week, you probably have noticed that there has been an Ubisoft sale going on.  Each day a new game has been put on sale (Monday Assassin's Creed, Tuesday Prince of Persia 4 (? the latest one), Wednesday was Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway, and Thursday saw a good deal on Far Cry 2.  All of them were exceptionally good deals and I want to play all of them (except I already played through Assassin's Creed) - I probably will when I get back to the states.  However, the weekend deal was the greatest one, in my opinion:  four Ubisoft games - Beyond Good & Evil, IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946, Far Cry, and Dark Messiah of Might and Magic - for $10!  Supposedly.
When I clicked on the banner ad on the front page of the Steam store it took me to <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sub/1511/">this page</a>, but lo and behold there were only three games included in the package.  I naturally thought this was incredibly odd since it listed all of the games in the banner ad and said that it included "All four games for one low price."  I did a little bit of searching and found that at least one other person had the same problem (<a href="http://www.evilavatar.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1734362#post1734362">click here</a> for the thread) - to which someone else suggested it might be an international restriction.  To confirm this, I did a little test:  using some ssh tunneling and a SOCKS proxy I made it appear to steam as though my IP was in the states (instead of India) and sure enough - the other game popped right up in the list.  So apparently there's an international restriction on Dark Messiah of Might and Magic...

Edit: I found out some more information - go <a href="http://palgn.com.au/viewtopic.php?p=546097&sid=017b55a59efc133728165ce075a16a96">here</a> for a list of the countries that are restricted.
