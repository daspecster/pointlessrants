<cite title="Morpeus Quote" lang="English">"Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure it was real? What if you were unable to awake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world, and the real world?" -  Morpheous, The Martix</cite>

That kind of sums up the previous NASDAQ bubble and perhaps even more so the current building bubble.

Now I really hope that we're not heading into a technology bubble, and I'll tell you why.

I live in Michigan and from my perspective, industry in the United States is pretty much on the way out. My hope is that a the new industry of technology and services replaces material and goods. That might be kind of a bold statement  but let me see if I can explain why.

Simply, I think we should be preparing for the demand of it.  Technology and services are going to get more popular all around the world and I think the United States should be leading the way as far as that goes. We have the tools we need to really own this area but we seem to be lacking the motivation.

It is possible that all these companies (<a href="http://blog.pandora.com/archives/press/2011/02/pandora_files_r.html" title="Pandora IPO Press Release">Pandora</a>, <a href="http://twitteripo.com/" title="Twitter IPO">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2011/01/27/linkedin-ipo-registration/" title="LinkedIn IPO">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703730704576066162770600234.html" title="Facebook IPO">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://about.skype.com/press/2010/08/ipo.html" title="Skype IPO">Skype</a>) are trying to  walk the path. It is possible that technology companies may be more financial responsible than they were 10 years ago, but I guess that's a ride we're about to embark on.

It would be amazing to see these companies leading the way for a solid base to turn the United States into a true leader in this area. These companies have some of the greatest talent in the industry and they have seen all of this before so I think we could be on stable ground. What I hope will happen is that this boost in the <a class="wikinvest-suggestion-link" articletype="industry" articletitle="VGVjaG5vbG9neSBJbmR1c3RyeQ,,_0" target="_blank" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/industry/Technology">technology industry</a> can be contained and fully utilized to help it move in where other industries are leaving.

So here's to an exciting future in technology!
