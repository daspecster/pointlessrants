<h1>Sprint SERO Upgrade for New Android Phones</h1>
So Sprint has had android phones for a really long time, since the HTC Hero or longer. Those of us that are on the SERO plan haven't been able to upgrade to these newer phones with Android on them for some reason. However as of October 1st, Sprint is now allowing you to upgrade your plan and get an Android phone. Â The upgrade called something about SERO Premium or something like that and it's an additional $10 a month. If you want the HTC Evo another additional $10 applies. So if you have the SERO F&amp;F 500 plan which is $30 and you get the HTC Evo your new price will be $50 a month. This is roughly$20 less than the normal price a month for the simply everything plan.

Anyway it's a great deal if you're lucky enough to be grandfathered into the plan.
