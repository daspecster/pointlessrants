So I know Eric is really into Python so I thought I'd post this link to Miro for the <a title="PyCon" href="https://www.miroguide.com/feeds/9792?page=7">PyCon video podcast</a>.

This also a little plug for <a title="Get Miro!" href="http://www.getmiro.com/">Miro</a> which is a pretty cool video player/RSS feed subscriber. You can use <a title="Miro Guide find content!" href="https://www.miroguide.com/">Miro Guide</a> to find cool content to watch!

Miro has clients for pretty much all platforms(Linux, Windows, OSX).Â  It's even in the Ubuntu 9.04 repositories! So "sudo apt-get install miro" everyone!
