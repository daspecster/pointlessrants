While I was setting up a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/balthasar/">GoogleCode Project</a> the other day, I stumbled across the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ&eurl=http://code.google.com/projecthosting/&feature=player_embedded">The Myth of the Genius Programmer</a>, a presentation put on by a couple of guys from Google. They've got a lot of good stuff to say about open source projects, getting them underway, and making them successful. The most useful advice for me (at this point in time) is to get out there--nothing will happen if you never show anybody what you're working on. What are your tips for working with open source?

(Kudos to Steve for actually having contributed to open source projects.)
