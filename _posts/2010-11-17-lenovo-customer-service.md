<strong>DISCLAIMER - Pointless rant below!</strong>

Some of you may remember when I wrote about my <a title="Lenovo R500 Review" href="http://www.pointlessrants.com/2009/02/lenovo-r500-review/">Lenovo R500</a> a while back.

Well I have an update and it's not good! Here, you can read the situation your self.
<h2>Here is my plea to Lenovo...</h2>
<pre>Hello,
I purchased a Lenovo R500 on January 29th 2009.
The windows sticker that was on the bottom of the laptop has worn away
and I can no longer read the key that was on it.
It was a Windows Vista Basic sticker.
I was wondering if I could possibly get the product Key for it and
perhaps an OS CD?
Here is the Serial#: ###### from the invoice.

Here is the invoice number "Electronic Receipt for Invoice ###### --
shipped on 02/04/2009"

If you need anymore information I can provide it.
I can forward the invoice if you would like.

Thanks</pre>
Fair enough right? I figure ok, their sticker wore off so they will back me up with another key or a new disc.

Well silly me for thinking that...
<h2>Here's their response:</h2>
<pre>Dear Sir/ Madam,

Thank you for contacting Lenovo, the makers of ThinkPad and Think Centre products.

As I understand, you want to get the product key of your system since the key has worn
out.
We apologize as we will not be able to send you that since we do not keep any data of the
old product keys. You will have to purchase a new Operating System to get the product key.
You can purchase it directly from Microsoft.

If you have further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact the Sales Support
Department at: 866-968-4465 option 3 (9:00 am to 7:00 pm EST). We will be happy to assist
at that time.

Once again, thank you for contacting Lenovo.</pre>
So there you have it. Lenovo can't even take the time to figure out if I'm a "Sir" or "Madam"!

I don't see how a business computer company can operate like this. I will not use them for business purchases if they cannot back up their products.

I think it's pretty safe to say that my next machine won't be a Lenovo.
<h2>Free Vista Product Key!</h2>
If you can read it then you can have it!
