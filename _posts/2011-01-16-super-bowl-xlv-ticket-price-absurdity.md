**Warning Pointless Rant Ahead!**

I realize that this is America and we're super rich but this is kind of crazy. Nearly $500,000 for a seat at the super bowl!

There's only one seat that costs that much and it's near the hall of fame section.

There's still another hand full of tickets that have a 6 figure price tag!

There is a seat at the super bowl XLV that costs more than the salary of our president!

Why do we spend so much on sports?? Why can't super bowl tickets be even a couple hundred dollars? The tickets start out at around $2000 right now!

Here's the screenshots!
