When it comes to computers, I like to do things as fast as I possibly can.  I love discovering new keyboard shortcuts to minimize wasted time.  To that end, I'd like to share one of my biggest time-savers involving everyone's beloved Firefox.

<!--more-->Most of the internet uses Google to search.  But pointing your browser to www.google.com then entering your search query is too slow.  Most modern browsers now have a search box in the upper right, but I think it's too slow (Even if you press CTRL+E to put the cursor in the box) and poorly implemented (I hate how there isn't an option to immediately clear the window after searching).  Here is a much better and faster way.

First of all, be using Firefox.  Then, point your browser to www.google.com.  When the site loads, right click in the search box and select "Add a keyword for this search".

(You may not have those exact menu options as I do due to Firefox Addons, but you should have the keyword option)

In the next window, fill in a title for your Google Search bookmark and add a convenient keyword.  I use "g" for my keyword.

Then, save the bookmark.

Now, you can use your new keyword to search Google.

In the address bar (you can put the cursor there faster by using ALT+D), enter your keyword followed by whatever you want to search for.  (For example, "g buell motorcycles")

Hit enter and you'll search for it.

It's that simple.  Just imagine how much time this simple trick can save you.

(You can use this trick on many other sites than just Google.  You can also add keywords for other Google searches like Google Images.  I use "gim" for that keyword.  Anyway, use your imagination and save your time for more important things.)

<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-size: small">I just stumbled onto an even better keyword setup that I'm excited about.  You can add a keyword to instantly search using Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature.  Just go to Google and bookmark the page.  Then, edit the properties of the bookmark to look like this:</span></span>

<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-size: small"><img src="http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/3529/propertiesc.jpg" alt="Properties" width="519" height="205" /></span></span>

<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-size: small">(Right click on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%s&amp;btnI=I%27m+Feeling+Lucky">this link</a> to copy what's in the Location: field</span></span> if you'd like to copy and paste.)

And voila... you've got an extremely fast keyword for those searches you do often where you always need the first result, but still don't remember the website.
