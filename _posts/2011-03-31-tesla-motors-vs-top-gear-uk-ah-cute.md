Tesla Motors used to have my affection and attention whenever they were in the news, but now they've decided to attack something else near and dear to me... Top Gear UK.

<a href="http://www.teslavstopgear.com/">http://www.teslavstopgear.com</a>

I'm sorry Tesla Motors, but you're insane.

Jeremy Clarkson spent nearly the entire first half of their review praising the Tesla Roadster in the episode in question.

But as they do with all their reviews, they also pointed out some "consumer" issues with the vehicle they review. They do this with every single car they have on their show. And guess what! It's entertaining!
Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May have dissed cars that cost several times as much as a Tesla Roadster.

Oh and so that we don't forget how much we're talking about here...The Tesla Roadster costs a staggering $101,500.
That's including the $7500 government tax credit!

So I guess the ~2000 cars that Tesla has <a title="Tesla cars sold" href="http://www.quora.com/How-many-cars-has-Tesla-sold">sold</a> (That's $203,000,000 btw) will all be returned due to this Top Gear turn down.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that if Tesla Motor's sales are really being affected so much by a UK car show Â then maybe they should listen up and fix the problems that were noted by the Top Gear crew.
