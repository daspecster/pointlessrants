Javascript use is really expanding at a rapid pace lately. Depending on how familiar you are with Javascript, this book will help you understand some of the things that you might find strange when looking at others code.

Addy Osmani is a javascript heavy hitter that works at Google and has helped develop some pretty well known projects like Yeoman and ToDoMVC.

I have been working with javascript lightly for about 8 years. Unfortunately, by javascript I basically mean simple one or two line DOM manipulation of jQuery and it's derivatives. Recently I've started to do some "real" javascripting and it has been a real challenge.  I wasn't really expecting it to be as difficult as it has been. Javascript feels a lot like the wild west when it comes to tools and standards.

Addy's book has been really helpful in explaining some of the patterns and behavior that I see in javascript that's out there.
