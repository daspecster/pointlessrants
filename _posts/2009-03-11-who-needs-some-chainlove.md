So I enjoy mountain biking.  I haven't road tripped across the entire United States to bike but I've watched everything <a title="The Collective Film" href="http://www.thecollectivefilm.com">The Collective</a> has put out. I have ridden some pretty good trails though.   Mostly I've ridden at <a title="Burfield at Trails.com" href="http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailid=BGM057-022">Burchfield Park</a> and some trails at Andrews University in Berrien Springs Michigan.  Along the way I have broken parts off my bike and I have wished that I had particular pieces of gear, but what's the one thing that sucks about mountain biking?  <strong>Gear is expensive! </strong>

So today a friend of mine showed me this <a title="Woot....Duh" href="http://www.woot.com">Woot.com</a> like website for hiking/camping gear called <a title="Steep and Cheap" href="http://www.steepandcheap.com/">Steep and Cheap.com</a>. This website is really cool, every 30 minutes or so a new item is shown that is on sale. Usually this item is about 50% off the original price.  Now that's cool for hikers right, but wouldn't it be awesome if there was a site like that for bikers too?  Guess what! <strong>There IS!</strong>

<a title="Chain Love" href="http://www.chainlove.com/">ChainLove.com</a>! Yes that's right! A new deal every 30 minutes and it's all biker stuff! Yay!

No I do not work for <a title="Chain Love" href="http://www.chainlove.com/">ChainLove.com</a> and I'm not affiliated with them in any way, I just love deals!

So here's some other deal websites that I frequent...
<ul>
	<li><a title="Woot!" href="http://www.woot.com">Woot.com</a> (yeah I know duh...)</li>
	<li><a title="edealinfo" href="http://edealinfo.com">EdealInfo.com</a></li>
	<li><a title="Fat Wallet" href="http://www.fatwallet.com">FatWallet.com</a></li>
	<li><a title="Newegg" href="http://newegg.com">Newegg.com</a> (Shell Shocker)</li>

	<li><a title="Steep and Cheap" href="https://www.steepandcheap.com/">SteepandCheap.com</a></li>
</ul>
Hope you enjoy!
