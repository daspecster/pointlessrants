<h2><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Ok, more than a cry for help, I want to know what motivates people in the technology industry.</span></h2>
Some of you may say..."Oh, it's obvious. We're in the coolest industry of our time." or "Um, have you seen these gadgets lately????"
But, I think there's more to it than what initially fires our neurons.
<h4><strong>Quote of awesomeness...</strong></h4>
<blockquote>Unfortunately, you can advertise in all the right places, have a fantastic internship program, and interview all you want, but if the great programmers don’t want to work for you, they ain’t gonna come work for you.</blockquote>
That's from the first line of Joel Spolsky's post titled "<a title="A Field Guide to Developers" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html ">A Field Guide to Developers</a>".
If you think you have this problem then READ the article.

<a title="Particle Tree" href="http://www.particletree.com">ParticleTree.com</a> has some brilliant writing and information that should be read on this topic as well(and many other topics).

This awesome video has a good explaination that kind of falls in with Joel Spolsky's view.

Jason Fried of 37signals has an interesting outlook on this idea of motivation as well.

<h4><strong>So what are some things that motivate us?</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Make money a non-issue. Salaries don't have to be extravagant.</li>
	<li>Give us a real purpose and direction.</li>
	<li>Try your best to make us comfortable(Chairs, noise, etc).</li>
	<li>Attempt to reduce destructive politics and micro-managing.</li>
	<li>Don't burn us out, we do that on our own.</li>
</ul>
