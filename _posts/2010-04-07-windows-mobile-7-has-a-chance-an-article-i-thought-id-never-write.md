WARNING: Pretty pointless rant ahead...

Ok, let's be real here. Windows Mobile hasn't really seen an update since PC2000 back in April of the year 2000(<a title="Wikipedia: Windows Mobile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mobile#Versions">Wikipedia</a>). That's a decade of not really putting money into this OS and it dominated the phone OS market for a long time.

Microsoft made what I believe to be a good decision when they decided to no longer support Windows Mobil 5/6 applications.  Some people may be upset by this but let's be honest, all your windows mobile 5/6 applications are not that good.   The applications have been driving the leading mobile OS's for the last few years.  The iPhone lead the way with their very large and hyped app store and then Google's Android followed suit.  I mean really, what's the point of having a powerful and awesome phone if there's nothing you can do with it?  Which leads me to the next question...

What applications are going to be available for Microsoft new mobile OS? Or will Microsoft leave the ability to use their shiny new operating system behind?

What Microsoft is offering is "SkyMarket".  I couldn't find a ton about <a title="Windows Mobile SkyMarket" href="http://wmpoweruser.com/?p=819">SkyMarket</a> but it appears that Microsoft is going to have an app store!

So the next question of course is, how good is their SDK?

Well you can download it here <a title="Windows mobile 7 sdk" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=71deb800-c591-4f97-a900-bea146e4fae1&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=71deb800-c591-4f97-a900-bea146e4fae1&amp;displaylang=en</a>

I guess you'll have to play with the SDK your self.

Overall I think Microsoft is heading in a better direction than they have in the past but I  don't see any innovation or excitement around this release, which leads me to believe that it will not be nearly as successful as the current leaders in mobile operating systems.

Microsoft had a real chance to come out with guns blazing but I think they missed their chance again.  I guess we'll see on April 12th when Microsoft unveils their shiny new mobile operating system.
