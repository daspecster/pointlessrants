<p class="MsoNormal">After a couple weeks of using the RC I’ve gone back to Vista. That’s right, Vista at this point in time is better. I would rather be running the Beta of 7 than the RC. Don’t get me wrong it looks promising but it’s just not functional. Well it is if you don’t plan on using any new devices or plugging you keyboard or mouse into a different USB port. The RC has problems recognizing new devices or devices that were not plugged in when the OS was installed. For example, I tried plugging a USB Flash drive in so I could get some drivers for another computer so I could finish setting it up. I put the flash drive in and waited and waited and waited…. Nothing, Windows just sat there trying to install the device. I then tried it on another RC machine same thing. Needless to say I was annoyed and put the project on hold for a while.<span> </span>I continued doing other work for about 45 minutes when I was alerted by Windows that my device was ready to use. Forty-Five minutes!!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My second issue with Windows 7 RC is that I cannot create a default user profile. I manage a couple of labs and need this feature to be able to properly test the OS.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I thought it was too good to be true that Microsoft would let us test drive the new OS for almost a year. I’d like to know if they intentionally broke the OS of if these are just bugs that still need to be worked out as they gut Vista from the OS and replace it with Server 08 code. Meanwhile I will continue to work with Vista x64 and play with OS: X and ubuntu 9.04.</p>
