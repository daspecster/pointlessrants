OK, this is pretty funny.  I've been reading <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">hacker news</a> since I read <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001236.html">Jeff Atwood's post</a> where he advocated it.  Today, I clicked on the bookmark icon for it and the following popped up:

<a href="http://www.daspecster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/erlang.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-322" title="erlang" src="http://www.daspecster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/erlang.jpg" alt="Hacker news is being slow." width="597" height="354" /></a>

Basically, the site administrator (Paul Graham) is saying that they're having some scalability and asks people to post and upvote "less fluffy" stuff (in other words hardcore hacker stuff).  He jokingly says to post stuff about the innards of Erlang.  So what do the users of hacker news do?  This:

<a href="http://www.daspecster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/erlang_links1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-324" title="erlang_links1" src="http://www.daspecster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/erlang_links1.jpg" alt="Erlang Links" width="608" height="350" /></a>

That's right, nine out of the top ten links are about Erlang.  Awesome.
