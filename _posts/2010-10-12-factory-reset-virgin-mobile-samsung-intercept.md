I don't know why but this was really hard to figure out for me.

Step 1:  Goto your home screen by clicking the little house.

Step 2:  Click on the menu button that's to the left of the house button.

Step 3: Click on "Settings".

Step 4: Click on "Privacy".

Step 5: Click "Factory Reset"

This will remove all of your apps and google account information but it will NOT ERASE the microSD card data.

Hope this helps people, the only post that came up for me mentioned restarting the phone and holding the volume down button but that didn't work for me.

I will be reviewing this phone soon! So far it's awesome for the price!
